Hello, I am **Raja**, a computer science master graduate specializing in neural machine translation. I am interested in NLP and Deep Learning in general. My research focus *was* on improving machine translation for morphologically rich languages by incorporating morphological information in the words in the model

## Recent Works
**Improving Neural Machine Translation for morphologically rich languages ​ (MS Thesis)**
> [https://github.com/Rj7/NMT-for-morphologically-rich-languages](https://github.com/Rj7/NMT-for-morphologically-rich-languages)

- Proposed and implemented an NMT architecture in PyTorch that can improve the
translation quality of morphologically rich languages like German, Turkish, Tamil, etc by
incorporating subword information.

- Successfully improved the translation performance on ​ German->English and
Turkish->English ​ by ~ 2-3 BLEU points against the benchmark transformer model

**Unsupervised morphology induction using word embeddings**

> [https://github.com/Rj7/Unsupervised-morphology-induction-word2vec](https://github.com/Rj7/Unsupervised-morphology-induction-word2vec)

- Implementation of the [Unsupervised morphology induction paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N15-1186) for CMPT882: Neuro Machine Translation course at Simon Fraser University

- Implemented morphological induction technique from ​the paper and used it to study the performance of different word embedding
models on their ability to capture the semantics of the words.

## Work experiences

### India (2012 - 2015)

After finishing my undergrad Engineering at MIT, Anna University, Chennai in Computer Science, I started my professional career in 2012 as a Network Engineer at [AGC Networks](www.agcnetworks.com). Worked on implementing various end to end high availability networks consisting of **APs, Switches, Routers, Controller and Firewalls**. Promoted as Lead-Projects. Handled a project from Project plan to Project Sign off.

I joined [Athenahealth Technologies](www.athenahealth.com), a cloud-based service provider for health care in 2013, where I worked on web applications in **Perl and JS**.

Then, went into a self-discovering mode for a year and tried my hands on travel startup in 2014. We built a personal travel assistant that was the one-stop destination for all your travel needs starting from travel planning, booking to the actual travel. Handled complete development process including architecture design, frontend and **Django** backend. I left the company and started my Master at UNBC, Canada in Computer Science.


### Canada  (2015 - 2018)


While persuing my masters at UNBC, I worked on a strategy based learning startup called [Road2Math](http://road2math.com/). I designed and development web applications using **AngularJS**, **socketIO** with **NodeJS** backend.

Parallely, I worked as an Android Developer in a Publishing company called [Angler's Atlas](https://www.anglersatlas.com). I also developed a research project (Python) that extracts locations specified in texts from social media platforms like youtube description and geotags them using NLP and Machine learning algorithms. It was essentially an [NER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) problem.

In 2017, I joined Timber Tracks Inc. where I worked full-time as **Full-Stack Developer**. I was developing a management / analytical tool to improve the productivity of logging companies. I developed web app (AngularJS), mobile app (ionic, Angular, TypeScript) and backend (Django - python)

I recently joined [Numerator](https://www.numerator.com/) as a **Senior Software Engineer** when I am working on a pricing intel application focusing on product matching.
